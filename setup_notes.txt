To send a new version to the package manager:

1. Make sure everything works and run tests 'nosetests3'
2. Update the version number in setup.py
3. 'python3 setup.py sdist' - this crate a dist package in the dist/ folder
4. 'python3 -m twine upload dist/zipfanalysis-XX.tar.gz' - replace the XX with the correct version number
5. Check on the pythoan package index that the latest version is the correct one
